# Polynomial

Creates a polynomial object, which is a linked list made of of individual nodes for each term in the polynomial.

11/14/2017 - Relies on the driver to create a polynomial.  Polynomial objects are stacks, so lower exponents are entered first
Includes methods to print the polynomial, add the polynomial, and multiply the polynomial.
Currently only allows operations on a single polynomial.

Wish list - 

Allow users to create a polynomial of any length (add sort & combine methods to check against user preference)
Possibly best to print out the full polynomial after each term entered by user.

Allow users to create a second polynomial, which will be multiplied/added to the first

Implement multiplication method that can operate on two different polynomials, possibly of different lengths
The functionality is there, just need to change the input and method to read a second object.

Implement addition method that can operate on two different polynomials.
This will be very easy, as addition currently only requires
